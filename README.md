# 📚 Overview

> Prefer the [RoboTwin Document](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/) for full guides — this README is a quick start.

RoboTwin 2.0 and [RoboDojo](https://github.com/RoboDojo-Benchmark/RoboDojo) share deployment via [XPolicyLab](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab): one policy-serving / eval stack across both benchmarks (single-task, multi-GPU, and remote server + local sim).

**Default branch:** [`main`](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin/tree/main) (RoboTwin 2.0).

# 🧑🏻‍💻 Usage 

## Document

> Full usage details live in the [RoboTwin Document](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/) — start from [Usage](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/index.html). Prefer the Doc over this README when anything conflicts.

## Getting Data
We provide over 100,000 pre-collected trajectories as part of the open-source release [RoboTwin Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TianxingChen/RoboTwin2.0/tree/main/dataset). **We recommend downloading the pre-collected data (step 1) as the default path** — it is ready to train on immediately. Collect data yourself (step 2) only when you need custom task configs, domain randomization, or embodiment setups.

> **Always decode through `decode_image_bit`, and always encode through `encode_image_bit`.** Downloaded and self-collected episodes store cameras as encoded image bits. Decoding them yourself is unsupported, because they come in two byte formats and a hand-rolled decoder is right on one and reverses the channels on the other. A local copy of the pair is in [`data/decode_image_bit.py`](data/decode_image_bit.py) — it is the same functions as `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data`. Prefer the XPolicyLab import when the package is available:
>
> ```python
> from XPolicyLab.utils.process_data import decode_image_bit, encode_image_bit
> rgb = decode_image_bit(image_bits)  # RGB for every data version
> ```
>
> Stored image bits come in two formats, and both decode to RGB:
>
> | Format | How it was written | What a standard decoder sees |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | **legacy** | an RGB array handed straight to `cv2.imencode`, which reads its input as BGR | red and blue swapped — the bytes are channel-reversed against the JPEG standard, and `cv2.imdecode` reverses them back |
> | **standard** | `encode_image_bit`, which converts to BGR first and stamps a JPEG `COM` segment with the payload `XPL-RGB1` | correct colors |
>
> Legacy data is never migrated — JPEG cannot swap channels losslessly — so the two formats coexist indefinitely and may appear in the same training run. Self-collected episodes now write the standard format. `decode_image_bit` tells the formats apart and returns RGB, so its output never needs a channel swap. Do **not** add `cv2.cvtColor(..., COLOR_BGR2RGB)` after it — the two formats are indistinguishable from any single sample, and that swap is the bug. Official LeRobot converters already call it; any custom training dataloader that reads these HDF5 files must do the same. Collection must not replace `encode_image_bit` with a bare `cv2.imencode`, which omits the marker and writes a buffer that reads back reversed. At eval time the policy server hands over decoded RGB, so `model.py` must not decode again. Details: [XPolicyLab — Decode only through `decode_image_bit`](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab#decode-only-through-decode_image_bit).

## 1. Download XPolicyLab-Format Data (Recommended)
Download and extract all available XPolicyLab-format trajectories from Hugging Face:

```bash
bash scripts/download_xpolicylab_data.sh
```

To download only selected tasks, pass their names:

```bash
bash scripts/download_xpolicylab_data.sh adjust_bottle beat_block_hammer
```

Downloads and extractions both run in parallel (defaults: 8 workers each). As soon as a task ZIP finishes downloading, extraction starts without waiting for the rest. Tune concurrency with:

```bash
# Parallel download / extract workers (extract defaults to HF_MAX_WORKERS)
HF_MAX_WORKERS=8 HF_EXTRACT_WORKERS=16 bash scripts/download_xpolicylab_data.sh
```

Downloads land under `data/demo_clean/<task_name>/aloha_agilex/data/` (note: self-collected data lands under `data/<task_config>/...` instead).

## 2. Task Running and Data Collection (Optional)
For custom task configs, domain randomization, or embodiment setups, collect data yourself. The following command will first search for a random seed for the target collection quantity, and then replay the seed to collect data.

```
bash collect_data.sh ${task_name} ${task_config} ${gpu_id}
# Example: bash collect_data.sh beat_block_hammer demo_randomized 0
```

Collected demonstrations are saved directly in the XPolicyLab trajectory format — no extra conversion step is needed:

```text
data/<task_config>/<task_name>/<embodiment>/data/episode_0000000.hdf5
```

`<embodiment>` follows the `embodiment` field of the task config (`aloha_agilex` for the default `aloha-agilex` setup).

## 3. Convert to LeRobot (Optional)

Many XPolicyLab policies train on LeRobot datasets. After you have XPolicyLab-format HDF5 under `data/<task_config>/<task>/<embodiment>/data/` (from download or collection), convert with the shared scripts in `XPolicyLab/scripts/`. Those scripts already decode through `decode_image_bit` — do not replace that with `cv2.imdecode` / PIL if you fork them. Stored bits come in two byte formats; only `decode_image_bit` tells them apart.

Patterns are `<task_config>.<task>.<embodiment>` and may use `*` wildcards. They resolve against `data/` next to the RoboTwin root (for example `demo_clean.*.aloha_agilex`). Keep `--data_type` as the default `RoboDojo` — RoboTwin XPolicyLab trajectories share that HDF5 layout.

Run in an environment that already has the matching LeRobot package (v2.1 vs v3.0). Conversion writes under `HF_LEROBOT_HOME` (default `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot`); point it at a large disk if needed:

```bash
export HF_LEROBOT_HOME=/path/with/enough/space/lerobot

# LeRobot v2.1 — all demo_clean tasks
python XPolicyLab/scripts/transform_lerobot_v21_format.py \
  "demo_clean.*.aloha_agilex" \
  --repo_id robotwin_demo_clean_aloha_agilex \
  --max_episode 50

# LeRobot v3.0 — same selection
python XPolicyLab/scripts/transform_lerobot_v30_format.py \
  "demo_clean.*.aloha_agilex" \
  --repo_id robotwin_demo_clean_aloha_agilex_v30 \
  --max_episode 50

# Single task
python XPolicyLab/scripts/transform_lerobot_v21_format.py \
  "demo_clean.beat_block_hammer.aloha_agilex" \
  --repo_id beat_block_hammer_demo_clean
```

Useful flags: `--repo_id` (output dataset name), `--max_episode` (cap episodes per task/embodiment), `--resolution HxW` or `--image_height` / `--image_width` (default: auto-detect; RoboTwin is often `240x320`). Output lands at `${HF_LEROBOT_HOME}/<repo_id>`.

## 4. Modify Task Config
☝️ See [RoboTwin 2.0 Tasks Configurations Doc](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/configurations.html) for more details.

Task settings such as `demo_clean` and `demo_randomized` are stored in `env_cfg/task_config/`.

## 5. Evaluate Policies via XPolicyLab

All evaluation goes through `scripts/eval_policy.sh`. The policy adapter must exist under `XPolicyLab/policy/<policy_name>/` (see the [XPolicyLab policy catalog](https://github.com/XPolicyLab/XPolicyLab/tree/main/policy)).

`--env-cfg-type` selects the XPolicyLab action profile (validated against `XPolicyLab/utils/robot/_robot_info.json`; `arx_x5` matches RoboTwin's default aloha-agilex layout), while the simulator embodiment stays controlled by `--task-config`.

**Local evaluation (multi-task, multi-GPU).** The scheduler starts a policy server and simulator per task on your GPU pool. Task lists and GPU settings live in `env_cfg/eval/all_tasks.yml` (trim `tasks` to a single entry for single-task evaluation):

```bash
bash scripts/eval_policy.sh multitask \
  --config env_cfg/eval/all_tasks.yml \
  --policy-name <policy_name> \
  --ckpt-name <checkpoint> \
  --env-cfg-type arx_x5 \
  --policy-conda-env <policy_env> \
  --eval-env-conda-env <robotwin_env> \
  --action-type <action_type>
```

Add `--dry-run` to validate the schedule without launching anything. Results are written to `eval_result/multitask/` by default.

**Split deployment (remote policy server + local simulator).** Start the server pool on the policy host, then point the local scheduler at it:

```bash
# On the policy-server host (fill in the placeholders first):
bash scripts/eval_policy.sh serve --config env_cfg/eval/remote_server.yml

# On the simulator host:
bash scripts/eval_policy.sh multitask \
  --config env_cfg/eval/all_tasks.yml \
  --policy-name <policy_name> \
  --env-cfg-type arx_x5 \
  --eval-env-conda-env <robotwin_env> \
  --enable-remote \
  --policy-server-ip <server_ip> --policy-server-port <port>
```

`--policy-server-ip/--policy-server-port` can be repeated to use a server pool, or configured once via `enable_remote` / `policy_server_ip` / `policy_server_port` in the eval config.
